# Hammer And Chord

This effect is a polyphonic string resonator.  It can provide its own impulse (to act as a synth) as well as resonating the incoming audio (e.g. a drum loop).  ([audio demo](audio-demos/hammer-and-chord.mp3))

It has two resonators for each note (left and right) and they can be detuned ([audio demo](audio-demos/Hammer And Chord detune demo.mp3)).

If your input audio is tonal (e.g. speech) and those frequencies are coming through, the "de-tonal" setting puts a ring-modulator before each resonator to make it atonal. ([audio demo](audio-demos/Hammer And Chord ringmod demo.mp3))
