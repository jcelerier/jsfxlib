# Echo Cycles

This is a feedback delay effect where the echoes move through the stereo space.  ([audio demo](https://geraintluff.github.io/jsfx/audio-demos/Echo-Cycles.mp3))

This is not done using an LFO, it uses a feedback structure with three delay lines for two channels - this means that the stereo position of the echoes is independent, which is good for building up textures.
