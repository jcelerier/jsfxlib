# PadSynth

This is a synth that specialises in smooth and thick sounds, with a bank of effects and assignable modulators that are calculated per-note. ([audio demo](audio-demos/padsynth.mp3), [additional audio demos](https://soundcloud.com/geraintluff/sets/padsynth-demo-tracks-2/s-xUWj6))

You can find more information and demos for this synth on its [main project page](https://github.com/geraintluff/jsfx-pad-synth).

The per-note effects can re-ordered and renamed, and the modulators can modulate any later effect in the chain, including other modulators.
