# Cross-Polyphonic FM

This effect is a MIDI-controlled frequency-modulator effect.  It can be used to add character to an existing sound (such as a different synth).

Multiple MIDI notes produces multiple modulation frequencies.  The notes aren't processed separately - they are added together to form the modulation waveform.  This means that different notes interact (slightly similar to distortion).
