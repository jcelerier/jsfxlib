# Stereo Alignment Delay

A tool to make small delays to individual channels, including a delay analyser.

Delay amount can be displayed in ms or samples.  (It is stored in ms, so if you change sample rate then it will preserve delay length regardless of the display format).

The delay analyser detects when one channel is ahead/behind or out of phase with the other - this can be useful when trying to get phases to agree in a multi-mic setup.
